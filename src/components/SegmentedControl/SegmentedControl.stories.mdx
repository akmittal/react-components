### Segmented Control

This is the [React](https://reactjs.org/) component for Vanilla [Segmented Control](https://vanillaframework.io/docs/patterns/segmented-control).
Segmented control can be used in two ways:

Secondary tabs: if the page already has a set of primary tabs used as navigation, this can be used as a sub-navigation of those primary tabs.

View switcher: in the case of a page in which the same piece of content is shown in more than one format, this component can be used as a switcher between the different views.
